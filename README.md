# DDLC-DSR
DDLC-DSR is a GUI modification that intends to scale DDLC up dynamically to any resolution outside of 720p (and can probably be used in other projects) based off NVIDIA/AMD's Dynamic Super Resolution (Virtual Super Resolution for AMD).

## What is this intended to do?
This is intended so players can play at higher resolutions than 720p and enjoy a more scaled experience. 
Also just for fun to see how far this can go.
